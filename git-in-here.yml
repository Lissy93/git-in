    Don't be afraid to jump strait in, it's the best way to learn and great fun too!
    Find a project you're passionate about, or start your own, as contributing is far
    more fulfilling when you're working on something that you really care about :)

    I use React as a library for most of my projects.The tools that I use in most of my projects 
    are VS Code, git and github. Javascript is my favourite language and I absolutely love it. 
    It has infinite potential when it comes to developing web applications.

    I want to get into open source because it fascinates me a lot, how I can contribute in ohters' 
    projects despite being a fresher. The best thing about open source, as its name suggests, is 
    that it is open to all to see the source code, suggest chsnges to it and even make the projects
    better by their contributions. When project initiated by one mind gets the expertise and ideas
    of multiple minds, it always turns into something more fantastic and unique.

    I want to get into open source because I want to be a part of a community of developers who are passionate about building and improving software. 
    I also want to be able to understand large codebases, and I believe that contributing to open source projects is the best way to achieve this. Additionally, 
    I am interested in learning more about the ways in which open source helps developers. For example, 
    I am curious to learn more about how open source projects can provide developers with access to new technologies, best practices, and feedback from other developers.
    In short, I want to get into open source because I want to learn, grow, and contribute to the development community.

   The first go-to resource for learning open source concepts alongside contributing to it is 'GitHub'
   . GitHub provides us convenience for contributing , raising issues and more things. YouTube is 
   also good for learning concepts. Going through documentation gives us a more clear and broad view.
   And lastly supportive friends from any social media platforms who encourages us to go forward. I 
   find these resources really helpful.

    Jetpack Compose is the coolest open source project I've come across & used. 
    It is a modern UI toolkit for Android that makes it easier and faster to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces. 
    It's declarative (intuitive Kotlin APIs) and Compose takes care of rendering it on the screen. 
    This makes it much easier to create complex and dynamic UIs, and it also makes your code more readable and maintainable. 
    Compose is also very fast and efficient, and it's easy to learn and use.

    I like to use three.js because it makes my websites look more eye-catching and also provides a 3D like experience to its users. Along
    with this I am an AI/ML enthusiast and love to learn new things. I am a MERN stack developer and love to work on making websites using
    react and express js. I like using java and am looking forward to learning springboot so as to gain experience in it. I have worked
    with javascript and absolutely consider as one of my most sought after languages.

    Python stands out as my preferred programming language due to its remarkable versatility and extensive library ecosystem.
    Its dynamic capabilities enable me to tackle a wide range of tasks efficiently.
    In particular, I frequently harness libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn for machine learning endeavors, harnessing Python's power to achieve my goals.

    Threejs or Webgl for react is definitely a project that amazed me the most . I think it is cool if we can add renderers with few lines of code and it also with some tweaking offers ray tracing , with which we can design interactive websites and games too.

    The language that i use most and love is Javascript.  
    My coding journey started with cpp(like most people) but soon i discovered javascript and immediately fell in love with it and since then it never let me down.  
    I also found out that using js we could do anything for example Machine Learning (using Tenserflow.js), create apps (using react native), backend, frontend and many more things.  
    I look forward to keep using it and make something cool with it in future.

    My most preferred language is Python as it has the easiest syntax of all the major languages. Python is very versatile language as it can be used in Data Science ,Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Web Scraping and many more. Talking about frameworks I prefer Django for production level projects and Flask or FAST API for small projects.

    I love using Node.Js, Express and MongoDB for server-side programming, since I am a backend 
    enthusiast! I wish to become a MERN developer, so I plan on learning REACT in the coming months.
    Apart from that, my university necessitates the use of C, and I am most comfortable in using it.
    Also I like using C++ for competitive programming and DSA.
    I have also learnt Java, and have used frameworks like SPRING along with RDBMS like MySQL/
    PostgreSQL for backend related stuff.

    In my work, I have a strong affinity for Python and its powerful libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
    I also rely on tools such as Microsoft Power BI and Tableau for interactive data visualization. 
    TensorFlow and scikit-learn are my go-to libraries for machine learning tasks. Additionally, I've explored deep learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch and have experience in text analysis using libraries like NLTK and spaCy. 
    These tools and libraries have been instrumental in my data-driven journey.

    I like to use Next.js as it provides certain additional features built upon React like routing, server-side rendering and authentication making it a powerful and efficient choice for building web applications and SEO-friendly websites. 
    The community support provided makes it one of the top choices for web development projects.

    Balancing open-source work with a day job can be quite challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding. First and foremost, time management is key. I make sure to allocate specific blocks of time for open-source contributions, usually during evenings or weekends, so it doesn't interfere with my primary responsibilities at work. 
    Prioritization is crucial too; I identify the most critical open-source projects or issues that align with my interests and expertise, focusing my efforts there. Communication is another vital aspectâ€”I keep my colleagues and managers in the loop about my open-source commitments to ensure transparency and manage expectations. 
    It's also crucial to set realistic goals and not overcommit, as burnout is a real concern. Ultimately, finding the right balance takes time and trial and error, but it's all about passion, dedication, and effective time management to make it work harmoniously.

    The coolest open source project I've ever come across is the Ultralytics Yolov8 project. Ultralytics YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge, 
    state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and 
    improvements to further boost performance and flexibility as a Deep Learning model for tasks like object detection, segmentation,
    classification. It also helped me ace my university project ;)

    The best advice that I can give is to start small. Don't immediately feel like you have to
    try diving into fixing big bugs or implementing advanced features in order to contribute.
    Fixing typos or adding unit tests are a great way to begin contributing.
    And if you are starting your own open source project, the same thing applies: Start
    with a simple idea that can be expanded upon, rather than expecting to be able to
    plan out and implement a complex program in one go.
