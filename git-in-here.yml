    I want to get into open source because it fascinates me a lot, how I can contribute in ohters' 
    projects despite being a fresher. The best thing about open source, as its name suggests, is 
    that it is open to all to see the source code, suggest chsnges to it and even make the projects
    better by their contributions. When project initiated by one mind gets the expertise and ideas
    of multiple minds, it always turns into something more fantastic and unique.

    The first go-to resource for learning open source concepts alongside contributing to it is 'GitHub'
    . GitHub provides us convenience for contributing , raising issues and more things. YouTube is 
    also good for learning concepts. Going through documentation gives us a more clear and broad view.
    And lastly supportive friends from any social media platforms who encourages us to go forward. I 
    find these resources really helpful.

    Jetpack Compose is the coolest open source project I've come across & used. 
    It is a modern UI toolkit for Android that makes it easier and faster to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces. 
    It's declarative (intuitive Kotlin APIs) and Compose takes care of rendering it on the screen. 
    This makes it much easier to create complex and dynamic UIs, and it also makes your code more readable and maintainable. 
    Compose is also very fast and efficient, and it's easy to learn and use.

    I also found out that using js we could do anything for example Machine Learning (using Tenserflow.js), create apps (using react native), backend, frontend and many more things.

    Balancing open-source work with a day job can be quite challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding. First and foremost, time management is key. I make sure to allocate specific blocks of time for open-source contributions, usually during evenings or weekends, so it doesn't interfere with my primary responsibilities at work. 
    Prioritization is crucial too; I identify the most critical open-source projects or issues that align with my interests and expertise, focusing my efforts there. Communication is another vital aspect—I keep my colleagues and managers in the loop about my open-source commitments to ensure transparency and manage expectations. 
    It's also crucial to set realistic goals and not overcommit, as burnout is a real concern. Ultimately, finding the right balance takes time and trial and error, but it's all about passion, dedication, and effective time management to make it work harmoniously.

    The best advice that I can give is to start small. Don't immediately feel like you have to
    try diving into fixing big bugs or implementing advanced features in order to contribute.
    Fixing typos or adding unit tests are a great way to begin contributing.
    And if you are starting your own open source project, the same thing applies: Start
    with a simple idea that can be expanded upon, rather than expecting to be able to
    plan out and implement a complex program in one go.

    I am currently developing an open-source project called 'Palettegram.' The idea for this project originated a few months ago when I was working on a client's project. I had to design a website based on the client's unique needs, which sometimes didn't align with standard design practices. During that project, I felt the need for a platform where design professionals could review my work, and I could draw inspiration from other designers. I realized that such a platform would be immensely valuable.
