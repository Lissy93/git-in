    Don't be afraid to jump strait in, it's the best way to learn and great fun too!
    Find a project you're passionate about, or start your own, as contributing is far
    more fulfilling when you're working on something that you really care about :)

    I develop in Python for my academic research. 
    I've had expereinces with machine learning using scikit-learn, tensorflow and pytorch.
    I'm trying to use pytorch with lightning at the moment to simplify a lot of my workflows.

    I use React as a library for most of my projects.The tools that I use in most of my projects 
    are VS Code, git and github. Javascript is my favourite language and I absolutely love it. 
    It has infinite potential when it comes to developing web applications.

    I want to get into open source because it fascinates me a lot, how I can contribute in ohters' 
    projects despite being a fresher. The best thing about open source, as its name suggests, is 
    that it is open to all to see the source code, suggest chsnges to it and even make the projects
    better by their contributions. When project initiated by one mind gets the expertise and ideas
    of multiple minds, it always turns into something more fantastic and unique.

    I want to get into open source because I want to be a part of a community of developers who are passionate about building and improving software. 
    I also want to be able to understand large codebases, and I believe that contributing to open source projects is the best way to achieve this. Additionally, 
    I am interested in learning more about the ways in which open source helps developers. For example, 
    I am curious to learn more about how open source projects can provide developers with access to new technologies, best practices, and feedback from other developers.
    In short, I want to get into open source because I want to learn, grow, and contribute to the development community.

   The first go-to resource for learning open source concepts alongside contributing to it is 'GitHub'
   . GitHub provides us convenience for contributing , raising issues and more things. YouTube is 
   also good for learning concepts. Going through documentation gives us a more clear and broad view.
   And lastly supportive friends from any social media platforms who encourages us to go forward. I 
   find these resources really helpful.

    Jetpack Compose is the coolest open source project I've come across & used. 
    It is a modern UI toolkit for Android that makes it easier and faster to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces. 
    It's declarative (intuitive Kotlin APIs) and Compose takes care of rendering it on the screen. 
    This makes it much easier to create complex and dynamic UIs, and it also makes your code more readable and maintainable. 
    Compose is also very fast and efficient, and it's easy to learn and use.

    I like to use three.js because it makes my websites look more eye-catching and also provides a 3D like experience to its users. Along
    with this I am an AI/ML enthusiast and love to learn new things. I am a MERN stack developer and love to work on making websites using
    react and express js. I like using java and am looking forward to learning springboot so as to gain experience in it. I have worked
    with javascript and absolutely consider as one of my most sought after languages.

    Python stands out as my preferred programming language due to its remarkable versatility and extensive library ecosystem.
    Its dynamic capabilities enable me to tackle a wide range of tasks efficiently.
    In particular, I frequently harness libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn for machine learning endeavors, harnessing Python's power to achieve my goals.

    Threejs or Webgl for react is definitely a project that amazed me the most . I think it is cool if we can add renderers with few lines of code and it also with some tweaking offers ray tracing , with which we can design interactive websites and games too.

    I love using Node.Js, MongoDB and Express for server-side programming, since I am a backend 
    enthusiast! I am a beginner, and I'm already loving it. To become a MERN developer, I plan on
    learning REACT in the coming months.
    Apart from that, my university necessitates the use of C, and I like using C++ for competitive 
    programming.
    I have also learnt Java, and I like using frameworks like SPRING along with RDBMS like MySQL/ 
    PostgreSQL for similar backend related stuff.
