Be it a Android application, IOS Application, Web Application, Desktop application, anything integration of theis code is done easily and also the managing of the software also becomes too easy.
<a href='https://github.com/Keshav-Aneja'>‚≠ê Keshav Aneja<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119158790?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **The advice I would give to someone new to open source is:**<br />For freshers stepping into the world of tech and exploring the realm of Open Source, I would sincerely advise them to focus on learning the basics first and strengthening that. After that, you can learn various frameworks or functional features on the go while understanding the project. This can help greatly in the long run when contributing to Open Source.
<a href='https://github.com/arungop'>Arun Gopinath<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53209422?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **Have you ever built or contributed to a project that you'd like to share with us here?**<br />I have created a wedding landing page for my friend. You can checkout: [Wedding Invitation](https://github.com/arungop/akhiarya). Another feel good project is web scrapping of weather data from IMD for kerala state (India).
<a href='https://github.com/robertlent'>Robert Lent<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7595802?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **The advice I would give to someone new to open source is:**<br />The best advice that I can give is to start small. Don't immediately feel like you have to try diving into fixing big bugs or implementing advanced features in order to contribute. Fixing typos or adding unit tests are a great way to begin contributing. And if you are starting your own open source project, the same thing applies: Start with a simple idea that can be expanded upon, rather than expecting to be able to plan out and implement a complex program in one go.

<a href='https://github.com/ananyasgit'>Ananya Agrawal<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109452550?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **What's the coolest open source project you've ever used or come across?**<br />The coolest open source project I've ever come across is the Ultralytics Yolov8 project. Ultralytics YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge,  state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and  improvements to further boost performance and flexibility as a Deep Learning model for tasks like object detection, segmentation, classification. It also helped me ace my university project ;)
<a href='https://github.com/omkarkirpan'>Omkar Kirpan<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14964401?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **How do you balance open source work, alongside your day job?**<br />Balancing open-source work with a day job can be quite challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding. First and foremost, time management is key. I make sure to allocate specific blocks of time for open-source contributions, usually during evenings or weekends, so it doesn't interfere with my primary responsibilities at work.  Prioritization is crucial too; I identify the most critical open-source projects or issues that align with my interests and expertise, focusing my efforts there. Communication is another vital aspect‚ÄîI keep my colleagues and managers in the loop about my open-source commitments to ensure transparency and manage expectations.  It's also crucial to set realistic goals and not overcommit, as burnout is a real concern. Ultimately, finding the right balance takes time and trial and error, but it's all about passion, dedication, and effective time management to make it work harmoniously.

<a href='https://github.com/alwenpy'>Arvind Srivastav<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94129388?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **Which tech (tools, languages, libraries, etc) do you most use or love?**<br />My most preferred language is Python as it has the easiest syntax of all the major languages. Python is very versatile language as it can be used in Data Science ,Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Web Scraping and many more. Talking about frameworks I prefer Django for production level projects and Flask or FAST API for small projects. Threejs or Webgl for react is definitely a project that amazed me the most . I think it is cool if we can add renderers with few lines of code and it also with some tweaking offers ray tracing , with which we can design interactive websites and games too.
<a href='https://github.com/debanath'>‚≠ê Debashish Nath<br /><img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57856461?v=4' width='80' /></a> | **Which tech (tools, languages, libraries, etc) do you most use or love?**<br />The language that i use most and love is Javascript.   My coding journey started with cpp(like most people) but soon i discovered javascript and immediately fell in love with it and since then it never let me down.   I also found out that using js we could do anything for example Machine Learning (using Tenserflow.js), create apps (using react native), backend, frontend and many more things.   I look forward to keep using it and make something cool with it in future.

## Contributing

Submitting contributions to any repository is easy!

The first step is to check out the projects contributing guidelines ([here's ours](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)). These will usually outline setup instructions, and give you pointers as to where and how you can contribute.

Next you'll need to either fork and clone the repo, or if it's a small change you can just edit it via the GitHub UI. [Here is a step-by-step guide](/guides/submit-your-first-pr-cli.md) to help you get started with that.

Finally, you can submit the pull request! Head back to the source repo, and you should see a new button, saying "Create Pull Request". If the author has set a PR template, be sure it's filled in properly.
