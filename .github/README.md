## Intro

The aim of this repo is to provide a roadmap, along with some helpful guides and resources to help anyone, of any level to get into open source.

Why? Because open source is awesome! It's the backbone for almost all modern software, and has enabled people from all over the world collaborate to build eipc stuff. It's a place where everyone has a chance to learn, contribute, and make an impact. The beauty of open source lies in its accessibility and inclusivity, with welcoming communities which are open to anyone.

If you're new here, and looking to make your first pull request, check out the [Git in](#git-in) section below, where you can submit a PR and have your name included on the list!

It so easy to use and navigate.  As a noob in Data science and Machine Learning and this tool has definitely helped make my work fun and easy to handle. I most especially love how I get error messages and also  a prompt as to where the error occured. I have always loved coding in python and one library I use a lot when working on projects is the Seaborn library. For me, it just gives a different feel to my visualizations.

In the beginning all of it can seem a bit overwhelming but truly just trust the process, your are definitely onto something great.

First and foremost, time management is key. I make sure to allocate specific blocks of time for open-source contributions, usually during evenings or weekends, so it doesn't interfere with my primary responsibilities at work.  Prioritization is crucial too; I identify the most critical open-source projects or issues that align with my interests and expertise, focusing my efforts there. Communication is another vital aspect‚ÄîI keep my colleagues and managers in the loop about my open-source commitments to ensure transparency and manage expectations.  It's also crucial to set realistic goals and not overcommit, as burnout is a real concern. Ultimately, finding the right balance takes time and trial and error, but it's all about passion, dedication, and effective time management to make it work harmoniously.

It is a modern UI toolkit for Android that makes it easier and faster to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces.  It's declarative (intuitive Kotlin APIs) and Compose takes care of rendering it on the screen.  This makes it much easier to create complex and dynamic UIs, and it also makes your code more readable and maintainable.  Compose is also very fast and efficient, and it's easy to learn and use.

And lastly supportive friends from any social media platforms who encourages us to go forward. I  find these resources really helpful.

The best thing about open source, as its name suggests, is  that it is open to all to see the source code, suggest chsnges to it and even make the projects better by their contributions. When project initiated by one mind gets the expertise and ideas of multiple minds, it always turns into something more fantastic and unique.

## Finding Projects

A common struggle for a lot of new developers, when getting started with open source, is just finding projects to contribute to. We've put together a guide to help you with this, see: [Finding Projects to Contribute to](https://github.com/Lissy93/git-into-open-source/blob/main/guides/finding-projects-to-contribute-to.md), as well as a list of projects tagged as welcoming for first-time contributors [git-in.to/find-projects](https://www.git-in.to/find-projects/).

The following hand-picked projects, may be a good place to start:

<!-- projects-start -->
- [https://github.com/lissy93/git-into-open-source](https://github.com/lissy93/git-into-open-source)
<!-- projects-end -->

Have I missed any? Add yours to this list, by including it under the `projects` section in [`resources.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/git-into-open-source/blob/main/resources.yml) and following the guidelines in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit a PR.

<p align="right"><sup><a href="#git-into-open-source">‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top</a></sup></p>

## Contributing

Submitting contributions to any repository is easy!

The first step is to check out the projects contributing guidelines ([here's ours](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)). These will usually outline setup instructions, and give you pointers as to where and how you can contribute.

Next you'll need to either fork and clone the repo, or if it's a small change you can just edit it via the GitHub UI. [Here is a step-by-step guide](/guides/submit-your-first-pr-cli.md) to help you get started with that.

Finally, you can submit the pull request! Head back to the source repo, and you should see a new button, saying "Create Pull Request". If the author has set a PR template, be sure it's filled in properly.
