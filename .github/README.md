## Intro

The aim of this repo is to provide a roadmap, along with some helpful guides and resources to help anyone, of any level to get into open source.

Why? Because open source is awesome! It's the backbone for almost all modern software, and has enabled people from all over the world collaborate to build eipc stuff. It's a place where everyone has a chance to learn, contribute, and make an impact. The beauty of open source lies in its accessibility and inclusivity, with welcoming communities which are open to anyone.

Even if you don't know anything about anything, learning will be  so much easier when you are doing hands on work. We often think that acquiring new skills or learning something new is going to take us a lot of time, which discourages us, but the thing is that timewill pass anyways. Keep at it and you will achieve something great!

Making contributions together not only helps numerous people develop their skills but also ends up  creating a beautiful end product and providing a sense of community and togetherness to programming.  I couldn't manage to find time earlier but now that I have some, I'm excited and eager to play my part in providing contributions and sharing my knowledge.

First of all, I make sure to not take office work home, I get them done in the office itself and then in the evening I look for issues on topics based on my interests and  believe me, it feels awesome when the thing you have worked on gets merged on the main branch, but we should not work for the result but work to learn from the journey and from the mistakes and optimize ourselves each day.

First and foremost, time management is key. I make sure to allocate specific blocks of time for open-source contributions, usually during evenings or weekends, so it doesn't interfere with my primary responsibilities at work.  Prioritization is crucial too; I identify the most critical open-source projects or issues that align with my interests and expertise, focusing my efforts there. Communication is another vital aspect—I keep my colleagues and managers in the loop about my open-source commitments to ensure transparency and manage expectations.  It's also crucial to set realistic goals and not overcommit, as burnout is a real concern. Ultimately, finding the right balance takes time and trial and error, but it's all about passion, dedication, and effective time management to make it work harmoniously.

## Contributing

Submitting contributions to any repository is easy!

The first step is to check out the projects contributing guidelines ([here's ours](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)). These will usually outline setup instructions, and give you pointers as to where and how you can contribute.

Next you'll need to either fork and clone the repo, or if it's a small change you can just edit it via the GitHub UI. [Here is a step-by-step guide](/guides/submit-your-first-pr-cli.md) to help you get started with that.

Finally, you can submit the pull request! Head back to the source repo, and you should see a new button, saying "Create Pull Request". If the author has set a PR template, be sure it's filled in properly.
