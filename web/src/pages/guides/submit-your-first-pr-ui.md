# Submit your first PR (UI)

> This page is a work in progress. PRs welcome!<br />
> TODO: I'm going to make instructions clearer, and add screenshots

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Start by visiting the GitHub page of the repository you want to contribute to.
- In the top-right corner of the page, you'll see a button labeled "Fork". Click it.
- This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. You'll be redirected to your fork.

  
### 2. Make Changes

- Browse through the repository files and directories by clicking on them.
- Once you've located the file, click on it to view its contents.
- Click on the pencil icon (it'll be labeled "Edit this file" when you hover over it) in the top-right corner of the file viewer.
- Make your changes to the file in the editor that appears.

### 3. Commit the Changes

- Scroll down to the bottom of the page. You'll see a section titled "Commit changes".
- Enter a short, descriptive title for your changes in the "Commit changes" box.
- Optionally, provide a more detailed description in the larger text box below.
- Ensure the radio button "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." is selected.
- Click on the green "Commit changes" button.

### 4. Open a Pull Request (PR)

- After committing, you'll be taken to a new page titled "Open a pull request".
- GitHub will automatically fill in some details for the PR based on your commit message.
- If you want, edit the title and description of the PR to provide more context or information about your changes. The more detailed and clear you are, the easier it will be for the maintainers.
- Once you're ready, click on the green "Create pull request" button.

### 5. Await Feedback

- The maintainers of the original repository will be notified of your pull request.
- They might provide feedback or ask for changes. Make sure to keep an eye on the PR for any comments or notifications.
- If changes are requested, you can make them directly in your forked repo through the GitHub UI, and they will automatically be added to the open PR.

### 6. Celebrate!

- Once your pull request is approved and merged, you've officially contributed to the project!
